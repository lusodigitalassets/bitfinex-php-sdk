## Overview

The **Bitfinex PHP SDK** is a lightweight PHP library designed to simplify interaction with the Bitfinex REST API. This SDK allows developers to easily integrate advanced cryptocurrency trading functionalities into PHP applications. Whether building automated trading bots, monitoring market trends, or developing custom trading platforms, this SDK makes the integration with Bitfinex straightforward and efficient.

## Features

- Comprehensive public endpoints: status, tickers (incl. history), trades, book, candles, stats, leaderboards, derivatives status (+history), liquidations, configs, funding stats; calc endpoints: market average price, FX rate.
- Authenticated endpoints: wallets, orders, positions, funding, account actions, merchants (Bitfinex Pay).
- Laravel integration (10–12): ServiceProvider, Facade and DI/container.
- HTTP via Guzzle with builders for headers/query/body.

## API Documentation

### What is the Bitfinex API?

The **Bitfinex API** provides access to the full suite of features available on the Bitfinex platform. It allows users to retrieve market data, manage account details, place orders, and more. Designed for speed, the API is optimized to support high-frequency trading and low-latency data streaming, making it an essential tool for advanced trading strategies.

### REST vs WebSocket

- **REST**: Best for historical data and authenticated operations but subject to rate limits.
- **WebSocket**: Ideal for real-time data streaming and high-speed market interactions. WebSocket connections allow for up to 5 authenticated connections per 15 seconds and up to 20 public connections per minute.

For detailed information on endpoints, methods, and usage guidelines, refer to the [Bitfinex API Documentation](https://docs.bitfinex.com/).

### Important Guidelines

- Use numeric error codes to handle exceptions.
- All timestamps are in UNIX format, expressed in milliseconds.
- Trading pair symbols use a `t` prefix (e.g., `tBTCUSD` for Bitcoin to USD).

### Legal Disclaimer

Any use of the Bitfinex API is subject to the [API Terms of Service](https://www.bitfinex.com/legal/api). All API keys and interactions are at your own risk and expense. iFinex Inc. is not responsible for any losses or damages resulting from the use of this SDK or the Bitfinex API.

## Architecture (High‑Level)

- Transformers (Strategy + Factory):
  - `PublicBitfinexResponse` delegates mappings to classes in `Http/Responses/Public/Transformers` via `TransformerFactory`.
- Configs (Strategy):
  - The `conf` endpoint uses `ConfigsTransformer` with strategies by mode (map/list/info:*).
- Builders:
  - `RequestBuilder` offers a fluent API for headers/query/body; for GET methods, body is not sent.
- Adapters (Template Method):
  - `JsonAdapter::transform()` is final; `UrlAdapter`/`PathAdapter` only define `getFilePath()`.

These patterns keep low coupling, testability, and safe SDK evolution.
